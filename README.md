# Ultimation
This is a server side NodeJS application for performing automated tasks such as API calls or web interactions. This can be done either through cron jobs or via API endpoints. This is meant to be setup once on a server and updated remotely. The automated system for handling updates will only support linux to start but will likely expand to Windows later.
